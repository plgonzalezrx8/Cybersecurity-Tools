# Velociraptor - Endpoint Visibility and Collection Tool

Velociraptor is an open-source tool designed for incident response, digital forensics, and endpoint monitoring. Its flexible and powerful querying capability allows you to hunt for digital artifacts and indicators of compromise across your entire fleet of machines.

## Features

### Artifacts

Velociraptor utilizes a concept known as "artifacts". These artifacts are definitions written in Velociraptor's Query Language (VQL), specifying what data to collect, how to process it, and how to present it. 

### Powerful Query Language

Velociraptor's Query Language (VQL) is a powerful and flexible tool to express complicated sequences of queries, process the data, and present it in a meaningful way. 

### Scalability

Velociraptor is built to be scalable, allowing you to collect and analyze data from a small number of endpoints to a fleet of thousands. It can function on a single standalone machine or be deployed in large and complex environments.

### Client-Server Architecture

Velociraptor operates using a client-server model. The server is responsible for orchestrating the clients, storing collected data, and serving the web-based user interface. The client software runs on each monitored machine, executing the server's instructions and returning results.

### Multi-Platform Support

Velociraptor supports multiple platforms including Windows, Linux, and macOS, providing comprehensive coverage across different environments.

### Customization

Velociraptor allows for extensive customization to cater to unique user needs, primarily through the creation of custom artifacts.

## Use Cases

Velociraptor can be used in various scenarios including, but not limited to:

1. **Live Forensics**: Collect and analyze data from live systems to understand ongoing activities or detect malicious activities.
2. **Incident Response**: Rapidly investigate security incidents and anomalies across your network.
3. **Threat Hunting**: Proactively search for indicators of compromise (IOCs) across your network to uncover hidden threats.

## Conclusion

Velociraptor is a powerful tool in the hands of incident responders and security analysts, providing deep visibility into endpoints and enabling efficient hunting and incident response operations.
