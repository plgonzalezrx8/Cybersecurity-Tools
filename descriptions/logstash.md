Logstash, part of the Elastic Stack, is a data processing pipeline that ingests data from a multitude of sources simultaneously, transforms it, and then sends it to your desired destination. It's designed to handle events and logs but can also process other types of data.

Here are some types of data that Logstash can handle:

1. Log Files: Logstash is frequently used to process system and application log files. This can include web server logs, system logs, and error logs, among others.

2. Network Data: Logstash can capture network data. With the appropriate input plugins, it can collect and process network protocols like TCP/UDP and ICMP.

3. Web Data: Logstash can pull in data from web applications via REST APIs or even scrape websites to collect data.

4. Database Records: Logstash can ingest data from various databases by using JDBC to connect and pull data.

5. Cloud Services: Logstash can gather data from cloud services such as AWS S3, CloudWatch, and others, using the respective plugins.

6. Message Brokers and Queues: Logstash can consume data from various message queues like Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.

7. Metric Data: Logstash can process various system and application metrics, like those from collectd, Nagios, and similar monitoring tools.

8. IoT Data: With the right setup, Logstash can be used to ingest and process data from Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

Logstash's ability to process different data types is greatly expanded by its plugin architecture, which includes inputs for various data sources, filters for data transformation, and outputs to send the data to various destinations.
